      <p>I&rsquo;ve started building a community that appreciates and nurtures the art of simplifying complex concepts. The main focus of this community is explaining very elaborate ideas and proofs, as we often see them in scientific publications, in a clear and concise manner.</p>
      <p>Scientific communication has been a passion of mine for a few years now and I’ve completed several projects in the field. Although no major breakthrough came, I&rsquo;ve learned a lot from my smaller projects (<a href="http://juretriglav.si/about">My projects</a>, <a href="http://tiris.org">Tiris</a>) and I believe this knowledge will come very handy in the future of ScienceGist.</p>
      <p>Let’s do this.</p>
      <p><small>If you would like to help out with ScienceGist or you have some ideas of your own that you would like to chat about, shoot an e-mail to <a href="mailto:me@juretriglav.si">me@juretriglav.si</a>. <strong>Thanks!</strong></small></p>
