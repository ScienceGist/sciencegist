        Take this paper for example: [High-molecular-mass hyaluronan mediates the cancer resistance of the naked mole rat](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature12234), and read the abstract:

          #### Abstract
          
          The naked mole rat (Heterocephalus glaber) displays exceptional longevity, with a maximum lifespan exceeding 30 years. This is the longest reported lifespan for a rodent species and is especially striking considering the small body mass of the naked mole rat. In comparison, a similarly sized house mouse has a maximum lifespan of 4 years. In addition to their longevity, naked mole rats show an unusual resistance to cancer. Multi-year observations of large naked mole-rat colonies did not detect a single incidence of cancer. Here we identify a mechanism responsible for the naked mole rat’s cancer resistance. We found that naked mole-rat fibroblasts secrete extremely high-molecular-mass hyaluronan (HA), which is over five times larger than human or mouse HA. This high-molecular-mass HA accumulates abundantly in naked mole-rat tissues owing to the decreased activity of HA-degrading enzymes and a unique sequence of hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2). Furthermore, the naked mole-rat cells are more sensitive to HA signalling, as they have a higher affinity to HA compared with mouse or human cells. Perturbation of the signalling pathways sufficient for malignant transformation of mouse fibroblasts fails to transform naked mole-rat cells. However, once high-molecular-mass HA is removed by either knocking down HAS2 or overexpressing the HA-degrading enzyme, HYAL2, naked mole-rat cells become susceptible to malignant transformation and readily form tumours in mice. We speculate that naked mole rats have evolved a higher concentration of HA in the skin to provide skin elasticity needed for life in underground tunnels. This trait may have then been co-opted to provide cancer resistance and longevity to this species.

        It is concise, but not understandable to anyone but scientists working in the field of rodent biology. Now read [the gist of the paper](#{gist_path(22)}):

          #### Gist
          
          This is a biology paper about the mechanism which gives [naked mole rats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_mole_rat) a really long life , roughly 7.5 times longer then comparable rodents. For example, [house mice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_mouse) live around 4 years while naked mole rats can live to be 30 years old. Not only do they live for a long time, they are also almost completely resistant to cancer. 

          Researchers used [cell cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture) of naked mole [fibroblasts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast) (a framework building cell) and found out that they are way more [gooey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity) then cell cultures of guinea-pig or mouse cells. They found out the substance that was making the cultures more gooey is a [glycosaminoglycan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosaminoglycan) (a structural molecule) called high-molecular-mass [hyaluronan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan) (HMM-HA). “High-molecular-mass” just means this hyaluronan is heavy, about 5 times heavier than human and mouse versions. Just a small amount of this substance is not enough to make the cell culture gooey though. The protein [hyaluronidase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronidase), which removes hyaluronan, is much less active in naked mole rats, compared to the human version, which causes hyaluronan to build up and make things gooey. 

          HMM-HA acts through a receptor on the cell surface ([CD44](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD44)) to make cells resistant to cancer. When you remove HMM-HA the naked mole rat cells become open to cancer again. 

          This new type of cancer defense is very interesting for further anticancer and life longevity research.

        By reading the gist **anyone can quickly understand** what the paper is about. Notice also how new concepts are linked to Wikipedia articles for easier deep diving into the knowledge pool. That’s what gists are all about.
